== README for SEEN

# **SEEN**

An application built to solve the problem of addressing the unaddressed, and seeing the unseen. 

In major slums across the world, one of the major barricades to human rights, access to resources, and economic progress is the lack of a physical, identifiable address for the over 1.1B people who call the neighborhoods home. 

SEEN is a universal addressing application that allows users to sign up and add their home's coordinates (latitude and longitude) in order to receive a dynamically generated, easily utilized, and locationally accurate physical address that they can claim for their own. This address does not rely on a grid system as many of the depressed neighborhoods are not organized in any kind of structured grid, and must rather depend on other navigational means.

Because a majority of people in these depressed areas have smart phones or similar technology, adding their location's coordinates is as simple as dropping a pin and grabbing the coordinates to be entered to the application. Mobile technology will continue to become more and more prevalent in these areas, opening up new opportunities for organizations and governments alike to be able to provide aid, infrastucture, and identity to the billions of people who call the areas home.

## **TECHNOLOGIES**

This app was built using:

- Ruby on Rails Application Framework
- JavaScript
- jQuery JavaScript Library
- Leaflet.js Maps API
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap CSS
- CarrierWave Bundle for Picture Uploading
